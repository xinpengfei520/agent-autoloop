# Says how much CI a run needs, as scope=docs, normal, kernel or full. Text no test reads skips everything, and everything
# else gets the quick tests. The simulation only imports kernel/ and protocol/, so those and its own parts add a short one:
# breaking each kernel condition in turn showed the quick tests already catch what the long runs do. The long runs come with
# nightly and before a release; a pull request only gets them for the two files nothing else would run, or a diff it can't
# get. What reaches main gets the quick tests, text too: a commit whose run a newer push replaced is checked by the next one,
# whatever that is.
