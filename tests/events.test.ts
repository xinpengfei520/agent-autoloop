// What a source sends becomes one event, and the rules decide what work it makes. Failure cases: an event missing its id
// or type, with a field too long, a link that isn't a plain web address, a subject that isn't an identifier (it reaches
// the Agent's prompt), or a misspelt field is kept; the same event sent twice is kept twice or makes work twice, as one
// with half a Unicode character in its id would be: it's stored and looked up as different bytes, so it never matches; an event
// matching two rules makes work for only one; an event no rule matches is dropped instead of kept for the owner to see;
// one source's event matches another source's rule.
