// The clock's events. Failure cases: a schedule fires when it isn't due, twice for one moment, or on a schedule that has
// just been changed; a hub asleep through several runs each of them (only the latest is owed) or none; a timer fires early,
// twice, or doesn't wake its own thread in its session; writing the same key makes a second timer; cancelling leaves it; a
// fired timer stops a new one being set under its key; a bad rules file stops the hub or isn't told; told every tick, or
// the card stays after it's fixed; a rules file that is gone stops the hub, or isn't picked up when it's moved back, or
// brings back a card the owner closed at every tick.
// Cancelling a timer that isn't waiting spoils the receipt it's in; a timer coming due after its rule has gone stops the
// clock for everything else, or starts something; a clock set back runs the same scheduled moment a second time.
