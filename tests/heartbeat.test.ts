// Being seen. A worker with work in hand asks every second and a channel polls all day; a fact is a disk sync and stays in
// the log for good, so being seen only goes in as often as the judgements on it can use.
// Failure cases: a minute of asking writes a fact per ask, or one per run in hand; an idle worker or a channel, back every
// 50 seconds, writes every time; holding stamps back makes a worker that is there look gone, so a run it keeps reporting goes
// in doubt, it's told as offline, or one missed poll shows it as not online; or makes a worker that is gone look there, so a
// run in the hand of a worker gone quiet goes in doubt instead of waiting for it; a run no longer reported is never judged,
// or judged more than a stamp's lag early; the offline card stays open on the way back, or the run in hand isn't renewed by
// the same ask that brings the worker back; a held-back ask also holds back a claim or a cancel; someone else's run, or a
// run past holding, makes every ask a write or gets stamped; a clock set back leaves a stamp in the future that nothing
// corrects; holding back depends on anything but the time given, or the log no longer replays to the view.
