// What the owner stopped stays stopped, and what comes back to a thread comes back to that thread. Failure cases: a run told
// to stop hands in a failure and is queued again, so it starts again minutes later; the card saying it will try again stays
// open once it's stopped, and needs clearing by hand; after a rule stops running in parallel, an answer or a due check starts a
// run on another thread, whose context has neither the answer nor the check, so the question is never really answered.
