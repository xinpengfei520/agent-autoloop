// Naming a run: `stop` and `why` with no number, or with a word that is not one, used to send /v1/runs/NaN to the hub and
// print "没有这个地址", which reads like a broken hub rather than a mistyped command. Found here by running the real program in a home nothing is installed into: the usage must come before any hub is asked.
// A hub that doesn't answer was said as a bare "fetch failed", with no word of which hub or what to do.
