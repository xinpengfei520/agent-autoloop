// The worker turns jobs into agents and what they say into results. Real processes run here (small shell scripts), because
// what matters is what happens across their lives. Failure cases: a job starts anywhere but its rule's folder, or without
// the prompt and the context file, or with the hub's secrets in its environment; a bad exit code or no last message counts
// as work done; a finished run's result is lost when the hub can't be reached just then, sent again after the hub took it,
// or a refused one is retried for ever; a run still going after the worker restarts is reported as finished or forgotten; a
// job lost to a stop before it launched isn't launched; a missing folder or an agent with no adapter isn't reported as
// failed; a run over its time or told to stop goes on, or leaves its children behind; the hub is told it stopped before it
// has; more than capacity at once are taken; a claim is thrown away before its job has arrived; a receipt that can't be read
// redoes the work, isn't asked for again, is asked for without end, or is dropped without telling the owner; a session that
// can't be gone on in fails the run instead of starting a new one, or keeps trying; a turn that went on in its session and
// then broke, said nothing, or vanished is run again in a new one, or loses that session; a turn's end that doesn't exit holds its
// place for ever; an old turn's exit is taken for a new one's; the hub gone for ten minutes isn't told, told every minute,
// taken as told when the telling failed, tried without end, or not told again after it came back and went away again.
// Session-cumulative usage must become per-launch deltas, including after a worker restart.
// A shell replacing itself with the final move must not lose its identity before the exit file is published.
// A failed or timed-out receipt repair must preserve the original business outcome; cancellation must reap a child
// ignoring SIGTERM even after restart; adding usage must not turn a missing price into a reported zero.
// A plugin that can't read what it printed, or gives back nothing, ends the worker, holds the run for ever, counts a run still
// going as ended, or starts its prompt again in a new session, whether the run ended or vanished; or hands in a session made
// up here in place of the one it read while the run was going, which a retry can't go on in; trouble with one run, like a
// folder it can't write to, holds up the others, ends the worker or fills the log. Over ACP, a retry in a session a turn
// already started in that breaks before the prompt redoes the work in a new one, or does so because something else has the
// session open just now, and one the agent refuses or can't go on in doesn't get a new one; a "没跑成" after a finished tool
// call is run together with what came before it and counts as work done; a failed turn whose agent won't go, or leaves
// something holding its output, or closes its output and stays, holds its place until the time limit and loses the real
// reason.
